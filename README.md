# Bouncing Balls

## Description

This project was built using HTML, CSS and JS. Every time the user clicks on any part of the field, a circle will appear in that place and, obeying the law of gravity, will begin to descend (note that there cannot be more than 15 circles in the field, if you try to create 16, the first one you created will be erased from the screen region).

## Features

* Variable field boundaries.
* Fixed and random ball colors.
* Variable balls sizes.
